<h1>Counselling at OrphanCare</h1>
<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:Arial; font-size:18px;">OrphanCare offers counselling services to these ‘clients’.</p>
<table align="center">
	<tr>	
		<td><li>Children from institutions who are in the process of being reintegrated into a family</li><br>
		<li>Parents and family members who are involved in a reintegration process at their home</li><br>
		<li>Young girls and women coping with an unplanned pregnancy</li><br>
		<li>Birth mothers who have decided to give a child up for adoption</li><br>
		<li>Adoptive parents dealing with integrating an adopted child into their family</li><br>
		<li>Foster carers who need parenting advice and skills</li></td><br>
	</tr>
</table>
<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:Arial; font-size:18px;">The reintegration process can last for months, even years. Counselling helps the client cope with a potentially very stressful situation.
<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:Arial; font-size:18px;">OrphanCare is committed to providing help until the client is stable enough to manage alone.

		<td><h1><b>What is Counselling</b></h1>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:century gothic; font-size:18px;">Counselling is a professional relationship that empowers individuals,</p>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:century gothic; font-size:18px;">families and groups to attain mental health, wellness, education, and life goals.</p>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:century gothic; font-size:18px;">Sometimes one session is enough. The opportunity to talk about an issue may make things clearer.</p>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:century gothic; font-size:18px;">Sharing a concern can relieve anxiety and other uncomfortable feelings.</p></h1></td>

<br><br>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:Arial; font-size:20px;"><b>Goals of counselling</b></p>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:Arial; font-size:18px;">The main objective is to bring about a voluntary change in the client. Counsellors cannot ‘fix’ other</p>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:Arial; font-size:18px;">people’s problems. They work on improving the client’s own problem solving and coping skills. A</p>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:Arial; font-size:18px;">counsellor represents an opportunity for the client to vent feelings and issues to a trained</p>
		<p class="ex1"; style ="color:black; text-align:center;font-family:Arial; font-size:18px;">professional. The client is gently guided to make decisions and take action through more informed choice.</p>
<br><br>
<table align="center">
	<tr>
		<th>Counselling involves:</th>
